Given the recent changes to the international funding landscape impacting the DPG ecosystem, the DPGA Secretariat and UNDP cordinated draftin a public group letter on behalf of DPGs (signed by them), highlighting and reiterating the value of investing in the maintenance and support of digital public goods. The aim is to circulate this among funders and other relevant stakeholders to help underscore the global value of continuing to invest in DPGs. If you will like to support DPGs, here are three (3) ways you can:

1. Sign this letter with your name and organization affliation to support us by following this guide.
2. Share [this letter](https://dpgalliance.github.io/dpg-public-letter/dpg-sustainability-letter) (click the atatched link to copy) with your network.
3. If you fall into any of the groups below, kindly consider our asks:

| Group | Summary of Ask |
| - | - |
| Donors and Funders | Support countries by supporting the DPGs they rely on. Supporting the ongoing maintenance costs of DPG core functionalities, in addition to country implementations, helps ensure the long-term efficacy of your investments. Funding that goes beyond initial product development is essential for ongoing maintenance, security updates, and scalability, which in turn creates opportunities for non-traditional sustainability models and reduces dependencies on donor funding over time. Investing in the maintenance of our solutions is insurance for digital resilience, innovation, and equity across the globe. |
| Countries, Agencies, and Organisations | Look before you build or buy. DPGs provide you the ability to choose cost-effective, tailored solutions for your specific needs and contexts while maintaining ownership of your core infrastructure. We ask you to develop open source-first policies and review your procurement processes and policies to help ensure our solutions are considered in procurement processes. |
| System Integrators and Hyperscalers | DPGs are reliable, open source building blocks that enable rapid development and deployment. At the same time, they foster collaboration and shared innovation, saving time and resources. We encourage you to consider contributing a percentage of your gross profits back to the DPGs you assist your clients in implementing in order to assist with our own sustainability. |
| Advocates | The loss of DPGs would potentially disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing inequalities. We ask you to continue to advocate for DPGs in your interactions with decision makers and relevant stakeholders. |
